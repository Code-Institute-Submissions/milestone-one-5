#Darwiche Band - Milestone One Project for Code Institute Fullstack Web Developer course


###This is a site created for my rock band Darwiche

**UX**

##Owner
#####For the owner the goals are:

* Increase band visibility
* Brand awareness
* Showcase music
* Inform users of upcoming shows 
* Generate a mailing list of subscribers 

#####For the user the goals are:

* Gain knowledge about the band
* Listen to music created by the band
* Get information regarding upcoming shows
* Find out how to get relevant information from the band on a regular basis
* Get to know more about their favorite band member or members
* Purchase merch with band branding
* Book the band for various events

##User Stories

As a user I want to find out if my favorite band, Darwiche, have any upcoming shows near me. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, 
diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), 
or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

##Features

* About:    This section gives the user a very brief background about the band and its current state
* Music:    This section allows users to listen to music recorded/created by the band by using the media player
* Shows:    This section allows users to get immediate information regarding upcoming shows they might wish to attend
* Pictures: This section gives the user more specific information about each individual band member
* Contact:  This section gives the user information as to how to contact the band and also includes a call to action to subscribe
Users can subscribe to a mailing list if they wish to be regularly informed about relevant band news by filling out the email form and clicking the submit button 
(**note that the subscribe action does not actually currently function due to this site being simply a static site with no backend**)

##Features not addressed in this iteration of the site and my reasons for not including them

* Shop:     I didn't include this section as it requires backend coding far beyond my current level of knowledge
* Booking:  Similar to the contact section, I didn't include this as I want to have it as a call to action on the 
landing page and use a automation driven overlay which would require the use of javascript the knowledge of which is beyond my current level.

##Technologies Used

* HTML5
* Css3
* Bootstrap
* jQuery - Used for the media player which was sourced from http://amazingaudioplayer.com
* javascript - Used by the media player

##Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to 
legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go 
over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, 
provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much 
detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
